# Introduction

This small collection of code and notes in markdown format is from following through the PluralSight course, [Unit Testing in Python](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/unit-testing-python). All code featured is presumably written by the course's instructor, Emily Bache.

The course aims to teach learners about testing methodologies and good testing habits for anyone serious about Python programming.

# Installation Requirements 

To follow through this course and run the code, the following python modules need to be installed:

- [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)
- [`pytest`](http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html)
